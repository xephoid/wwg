    <div>Welcome to the Warble Way Galaxy solo RPG! Let's embark on an exciting journey through the cosmos. First, we'll start with creating your character.</div>
    <div><ul>
      <li><strong>Name: </strong>What is the name of your character?</li>
      <li><strong>Race: </strong>Choose one from Kralkin, Hexapod, Human, and Grull.</li>
      <li><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Allocate your ability scores. Pick one score to be +3, another to be +2, and a third to be +1. These scores will add bonuses to your missions and challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>Ship Name: </strong>What is the name of your spacecraft?</li>
    </ul>
    Once you've decided on these details, let me know, and we'll confirm each one before proceeding to the next step!`
